<h1 align="center"> kbd-mangler </h1>
Version 2.X <br /><br />

<i>

If you happen to know kbd-mangler 0.3 - The version 2.0 and above is something completely different,
consider it an entirely new program, forget
that previous versions ever existed and read the entire documentation again.
<br /><br />
The main highlights of the new architecture are:
<ul>
  <li>No need to touch kernel</li>
  <li>Write your manglers in JavaScript</li>
</ul>

If you are interested, here is the <a href="old.html">documentation of the 0.3 version</a>.
<br /><br />
NOTE: the old versions and old architecture is no longer maintained, sorry.

<span style="color:red; font-size:20px">
An important note for the impatient:<br />
Before you start mangling, please read the README file, especially the RESCUE SEQUENCE section, otherwise you may find yourself wishing
to kill me because your system stopped to respond to keyboard until a hard-reset.

<h3> Introduction </h3>

kbd-mangler is a tool to modify the keyboard behaviour
at a low level. Modifications are transparent for the
entire system and work naturally with any console or X application.
<br><br>

kbd-mangler grabs the keyboard input device (/etc/input/event3, or something like this)
and forwards ALL keyboard events to the specified mangler script.<br />
Mangler script does whatever it wants with the events and emits events to the uinput device (/dev/uinput).<br />
The System does not know know whether it receives genuine events from your hardware or mangled events from kbd-mangler.
<br /><br />
Mangler scripts are written in JavaScript aka ECMA-262.
<br /><br />

<h3> FAQ </h3>

<a name="faq_what">
  <b>What can I use kbd-mangler for?</b>
  <br><br>

  You can do anything with keyboard events before the system gets a chance to interprete them.
  <br><br>
  
<a name="faq_example">
  <b>I don't get it, can you give me an example?</b>
  <br><br>

  I was using kbd-mangler to make that part of the keyboard to the right
  from the &lt;Enter&gt; key entirely obsolete. Space key pressed in
  combination with some letter keys 'simulates' the arrows and other
  'obsolete' physical keys.<br /><br />
  Why? Well, I wanted my hands to always stay at the classical blind-typing position and never move away.
  check <code>js/examples/aux_key.js</code>
  <br><br>
  Other examples included in the distribution are:<br />
  <code> js/examples/abbr.js </code> - configure any number of abbreviations that get expanded automatically in ANY application as you type.<br />
  <code> js/examples/aux_mouse.js </code> - control your mouse pointer with keyboard.<br />
  <br><br>

<a name="faq_app">
  <b>How do I make kbd-mangler work with my console / X application xyz?</b>
  <br><br>

  The advantage of kbd-mangler and one of the reasons for its existence
  is that it works on the level much lower than distinction between
  any console or X applications. It modifies the keyboard behaviour at it's
  very origin.
  <br>
  <i>Thus <b>ANY</b> program expecting keyboard input will be affected
  by kbd-mangler without any specific configuration regardless whether it is
  a console or an X application.
  </i>
  <br><br>

<a name="faq_system">
  <b> What systems will kbd-mangler run on? </b>
  <br><br>

  It will work out of the box on Linux running
  stock kernel versions 2.6.x.
  <br><br>

<br><br>

<a name="faq_knowledge">
  <b> What do I need to know to use kbd-mangler? </b>
  <br><br>

  Currently you must speak JavaScript. There are a few working examples included in the distribution.
  They will help you to get started quickly. When you get the idea, only your imagination is a limit.
  <br />
  Also read the README file, it will explain the simple javascript API you need to understand.
  <br><br>

<br><br>

<a name="faq_js">
  <b> Why JavaScript? What does this software have to do with a browser? </b>
  <br><br>
  I have chosen JavaScript, because I consider it a fairly simple language suitable perfectly for purposes like this, and easy to embed
  as a scripting solution.<br /><br />

  If JavaScript is hardly associated with web and browsers in your mind - the short answer is: JavaScropt is another programming language
  that does not necessarily have anything to do with browsers. A lot of software uses JavaScropt/ECMAScropt as a scripting engine. So
  does kbd-mangler.<br /><br />
  
<br><br>


<a name="faq_nojs">
  <b> I want no JavaScript, I want C (or any other language). </b>
  <br><br>
  Sorry, in this case you are on your own. The main.c file is a good knowledge base and starting point to create your manglers in whatever
  language you want.<br /><br />
  However, before you start, think about a few things:
  <ul>
    <li> If your concern is performance - believe me, unless you need something really weird and heavy, javascript is definitely performant 
      enough for something like kbd-mangler. With the included examples you'll never notice it with "top".</li>
    <li> If you consider to share your mangler and someone less experienced comes across it,
      JS is much simpler to start with and hack around. (Consider this statement limited to the context of writing kbd-mangler logic)</li> 
  </ul>

<br><br>


<a name="faq_kbd">
  <b>Can kbd-mangler be used for any events other than keyboard?</b>
  <br><br>
  Though kbd-mangler's main purpose is consuming and producing keyboard events it works with linux events, thus it may
  be easily extended/adapted to work with any events.<br /><br />
  kbd-mangler can emit any type of events out of the box. See <br />
  <code>js/examples/aux_mouse.js</code>
  <br />
  It demonstrates how you can use kbd-mangler for emulating mouse with keyboard.

  <br /><br />
  I do not intend to actively continue development on this project as long as there is no evidence that anyone needs it or needs my help. <br /><br />
  It is a working system and I have put together a few examples giving enough idea how to make something cool and usefull out of it.<br /><br />
