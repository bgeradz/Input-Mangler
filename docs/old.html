<h3> Introduction </h3>

kbd-mangler is a tool to modify the keyboard behaviour
at a low level in the linux kernel. Modifications are transparent for the
entire system and work naturally with any console or X application.
<br><br>

kbd-mangler provides a high degree of flexibility and in addition to
existing features it is very easy to implement any custom behaviour.
See the section <a href="#architecture">architecture</a> to understand
how it works.

<h3> FAQ </h3>

<a name="faq_what">
  <b>What can I use kbd-mangler for?</b>
  <br><br>

  You can do anything with keyboard events before the kernel and the rest
  of the system gets a chance to interprete them.
  <br><br>
  
<a name="faq_example">
  <b>I don't get it, can you give me an example?</b>
  <br><br>

  I am using kbd-mangler heavily to make that part of the keyboard to the right
  from the &lt;Enter&gt; key entirely obsolete. Winkey pressed in
  combination with some letter keys 'simulates' the arrows and other
  'obsolete' keys.<br>
  See the section <a href="#manglers">Manglers</a> for the list of current
  capabilities of kbd-mangler.
  <br><br>

<a name="faq_app">
  <b>How do I make kbd-mangler work with my console / X application xyz?</b>
  <br><br>

  The main advantage of kbd-mangler and one of the reasons for its existence
  is that it works on the level much lower than distinction between
  any console or X applications. It modifies the keyboard behaviour at it's
  very origin in the kernel.
  <br>
  <i>Thus <b>ANY</b> program expecting keyboard input will be affected
  by kbd-mangler without any specific configuration regardless whether it is
  a console or an X application.
  </i>
  <br><br>

<a name="faq_context">
  <b>Is it possible to have context-dependent behaviour?</b>
  <br><br>

  Yes, but not out of the box, at least now. You will have to implement
  a mangler, capable of being informed of the current context, probably by
  some IPC means and switch the mode of operation accordingly.
  <br><br>
  
<a name="faq_system">
  <b> What systems will kbd-mangler run on? </b>
  <br><br>

  It will work out of the box on Linux running
  kernel versions 2.6.x. Though it should be fairly simple to adapt it
  for other kernel versions. If you want to make this kind of contribution,
  you are welcome.
  <br><br>

  I am not sure if it will work on any
  architecture other than common x86 PC's. <br>
  The kernel patch is against the file
  <code>linux/drivers/input/keyboard/atkbd.c</code>.<br>
  If someone can comment on this, you are welcome.
  <br>

<br><br>


<a name="faq_install">
  <b> What do I need to know to be able to install and use kbd-mangler? </b>
  <br>

  <ul>
    <li>
      You neet to know how to <b>compile</b> and install a linux kernel
      version 2.6.x and how to configure module loading.
      <br>
      Explaining how to build and install kernel is beyond this document,
      there are plenty resources covering this topic in depth.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>
      Basic understanding of the divice file management on <b>your</b>
      particular system. It will need different configuration depending
      on whether your device files are static or under control of
      devfs or udev.<br><br>
    </li>
    <li>
      Basic knowledge of shell redirection mechanism is necessary to
      understand how to invoke manglers.
    </li>
  </ul>

<h3> Architecture </h3>

kbd-mangler consists of the following parts:

<ul>
 <li> <b> kbd_interceptor </b> kernel patch. <br>

   This is a minimal patch of the file
   <KERNEL_SOURCE>/drivers/input/keyboard/atkbd.c
   
   allowing arbitrary kernel modules to easily:
  
   <ul>
     <li> intercept the keyboard events. <br>
      The intercepted event may be left without changes,
      modified and returned for processing or completely ignored
      so that kernel pretends no event has happened.
     </li>
     <li> generate arbitrary keyboard events at any time. </li>
   </ul><br><br>
 </li>

 <li> <b> kbd_router </b> kernel module <br>
   
   This is a kernel module utilizing the above kbd_interceptor patch.
   It creates two character devices to communicate with it's clients
   (<b>manglers</b>).
   This kernel module is intended to make the entire logic of keyboard
   behaviour modification to be driven by programs in user space.<br><br>
   
 </li>

 <li> <b> kbd_router clients </b> further called <i><b>manglers</b></i>.<br>
   kbd_router's clients or <b>manglers</b> are simple programs running
   in user space, reading keyboard events from a special input device file,
   and writing eventually modified events back to a special output device file.
   <br><br>
   kbd_router is designed so that custom manglers are extremely easy to
   implement and use. A few manglers implemented may be taken as examples.
 </li>
</ul>
<br><br>



<hr>
<a name="installation" />
<h3> Installation </h3>

<ul>
 <li> <b> patch the kernel </b> <br><br>

   Apply the patch located in kbd_interceptor directory.
   Currently only 2.6.x kernel versions are supported.<br><br>

   To apply the patch do the following:<br><br>

   <code>
   # go to your kernel source root directory<br>
   cd /usr/src/linux
   <br><br>
   # apply patch<br>
   patch -p1 < /path/to/kbd_interceptor-VERSION.patch
   </code>
   <br><br>
   rebuild and setup the new kernel as usual.<br><br>
 </li>

 <li><b>
   compile and install kbd_router kernel module and mangler programs
   </b><br><br>

   This is done by usual<br><br>
   <code>
   ./configure<br>
   make<br>
   make install<br>
   </code>
   <br><br>
   
   <b>NOTE:</b> make install will put the kbd_router module to
         <code>/lib/modules/VERSION/misc/</code>
   <br><br>

   <b>NOTE:</b> kbd_router client executables (manglers) all have the prefix
     <code>kbdr_</code> (to be found easily)
   <br><br>
 </li>

 <li><b> Create the kbd_router device files </b><br><br>

   This step is a little cumbersome, I haven't figured out how to make it
   easier.<br><br>

   First you must find a free device major number.<br><br>

   For me I have taken the major number 56. Here is the excerpt from
   linux/Documentation/devices.txt:<br><br>
   
<pre>
      56 char        Apple Desktop Bus
                     0 = /dev/adb          ADB bus control
      Additional devices will be added to this number, all
                 starting with /dev/adb.
</pre>
   <br><br>

   If you think this will interfere with your system, pick up another
   major number.<br><br>

   To tell the driver which major number to use the major number must
   be given as a parameter to insmod / modprobe, or alternatively configured
   via /etc/modules.conf<br><br>

   <code>
   insmod kbd_router.ko major=&lt;MAJOR NUMBER&gt;<br>
   or<br>
   modprobe kbd_router major=&lt;MAJOR NUMBER&gt;<br><br>

   After you have chosen a device major number,
   create two devices:<br><br>

   <code>
   mknod /dev/kbdr_read c MAJOR 0 <br>
   mknod /dev/kbdr_write c MAJOR 1 <br>
   </code>
   <br>
   
   where MAJOR is the selected major number.
   <br><br>

   After you complete the above steps, boot your modified kernel and
   insert the kbd_router module you should be able to invoke <b>manglers</b>.

 </li>
</ul>
<br><br>

<h3> Manglers </h3>

Following manglers have been implemented so far.
<br><br>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"> <b>kbdr_metamode</b>
    <td>A particular key is chosen to be the <i>meta key</i>.
        <i>(not to be confused with the META key in X-Windows keyboard
	    terminology. Meta key can be any key on the keyboard.)</i>
	<br><br>

        Further any keys on the keyboard may be configured so that
        pressing/releasing them in combination with the <i>meta key</i>
        will be substituted with press/release events of other arbitrary keys.
	<br><br>

        The number of key mappings is unlimited.<br><br>

	The <i>meta key</i> itself may operate in two modes, normal and
	extended. In normal mode events for the <i>meta key</i> itself are
	suppressed and not visible to the system.
	In extended mode <i>meta key</i> events are emitted only in cases
	when no other key has been pressed during the time when <i>meta key</i>
	was held down.<br>
        Extended mode allows an interesting application - you can mimic
        the behaviour of halfkeyboard (http://www.halfkeyboard.com)
	<br><br>

        kbdr_metamode requires path to its configuration file as a single
	argument. See the files in <code>manglers/metamode/conf/</code>
	for config file examples.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td valign="top"> <b>kbdr_ascii_expander</b>
    <td> This is a simple ASCII only macro expander.<br><br>

        For example you may wish the abbreviation 'dnd' to expand to the text
        'drag&nbsp;and&nbsp;drop' as you type. When you type 'dnd' immediately
	followed by any of the <i>terminating characters</i> this mangler will
	hit backspace several times to erase the word 'dnd' and then type
        'drag&nbsp;and&nbsp;drop'. Terminating characters are space,
        punctuation, etc (natural word terminators).
        <br><br>

        Abbreviations and their corresponding expansion texts are specified
        through a configuration file which should be given to
        kbdr_ascii_expander as a sole argument. The number of
        abbreviation/expansion pairs is unlimited.
        <br><br>

        Currently only US-ASCII keymap and charset are supported.
        <br><br>

        For a sample configuration file look at
        <code>manglers/ascii_expander/conf/sample.conf</code>
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td valign="top"> <b> kbdr_dump </b> </td>
    <td>
        This isn't really a mangler, that is, it does not change anything.
	It prints all keyboard events on the screen and is usefull for
	debugging of other manglers.
    <td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"> <b> kbdr_hello </b> </td>
    <td>
        This is a minimal example to demonstrate what is necessary to
	implement a mangler. it swaps the Y and Z keys.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td valign="top"> <b>kbdr_fixreturn</b> </td>
    <td>
        The only purpose of this obscure mangler is to emit the release
	of the &lt;Enter&gt; key. This was intended to fix the hanging
	of the &lt;Enter&gt; key in some situations.<br>
	Normally you won't need this.
    </td>
  </tr>

<h3> Invocation of Manglers </h3>

All manglers are designed to read keyboard events from standard input,
and write keyboard events to stdandard output. A usual mangler forwards
some events directly from stdin to stdout without changes and
modifies, generates or hides some particular set of
events.
<br><br>

Activating a mangler is as simple as invoking the following command:
<br><br>

<code>
cat /dev/kbdr_read | mangler [arguments...] &gt; /dev/kbdr_write
</code>
<br><br>

You can even cascade several manglers into a single processing pipeline:
<br><br>

<code>
cat /dev/kbdr_read | mangler1 | mangler2 .... manglerN &gt; /dev/kbdr_write
</code>
<br><br>

For example to print all keyboard events to the terminal invoke the following
command:
<br><br>

<code>
cat /dev/kbdr_read | kbdr_dump &gt; /dev/kbdr_write
</code>
<br><br>

<b>... but before you do anything, read the below CAREFULLY: </b>
<br><br>
<font color="red">
<h4> !!!!!!!!! IMPORTANT NOTE !!!!!!!!! </h4>
</font>

kbd_router is designed so that once a mangler opens /dev/kbdr_read,
the control of keyboard event processing is <b>COMPLETELY TAKEN OVER</b> by the
kbd_router and the [chain of] mangler[s] being executed.
<br><br>

Invoking manglers in a wrong way (or trying a badly written mangler)
can result in making the keyboard partially or completely inoperable.
<br><br>

Here is an example how to lock your keyboard <b>(DON'T DO THIS !!!!)</b>:
<br><br>
<code>cat /dev/kbdr_read</code>
<br>
or
<br>
<code>cat /dev/kbdr_read | some_client</code>
<br><br>

Once any of the above commands is launched the keyboard events will be dumped
to your terminal but won't cause any further effect, because nobody is
actually writing events back to /dev/kbdr_write. <br><br>

As you have noticed, both of the above have one thing in common: the pipeline
is not ending with <code> "&gt;&nbsp;/dev/kbdr_write" </code><br><br>

Thus to avoid troubles the rule of thumb is:<br><br>

<i>At any given time if anyone is reading the /dev/kbdr_read file
someone should also write to the /dev/kbdr_write file.
AND, if you are invoking it from command line - the whole pipeline should
be launched by a SINGLE SHELL COMMAND.</i>
<br><br><br>

Now when you know that you are walking on a VERY THIN ice, you should also know that if something goes wrong there is a nicely working <b>cure</b>:
<br><br>

kbd_router has a <b>magic key combination</b> to close /dev/kbdr_read on
it's end and return the system to the normal operation.
<br><br>

Thus, should your keyboard appear to be 'stolen' by kbd-mangler press
the following key combination:
<br><br>

<h3> Left CTRL + Left SHIFT + Right CTRL + Right SHIFT </h3>
