- LED management. Following observations:
  - Apparently system (at least X) does not necessarily set capslock LED according to the real input state of capslock.
    System TOGGLES the capslock input state and capslock LED's state  in response to the capslock key.
    These two states appear to be independent. If a mangler passes capslock key press through, but does not
    explicitely change the LED state, these two states become asynchronous after IM is terminated. That is capslock LED is activated
    when low letters are typed and deactivated when switching to capital letters.
  - after input-mangler is terminated all leds are deactivated. (If input state happens to be in "capital" mode at this moment - result is
    desynchronization describe above
  - every console (every text console and X console) has it's own led state - try to press capslock and num lock and switch consoles
    You'll notice that LED states are returned to the state in which you've left a particular console.

  - Probably need to find a way how to ask the system for the current input state (low/capital)
    Withough having this possibility IM wouldn't know what to do with leds (i.e. keep capslock LED synchronous with current input mode).
